# Mezzanine-Application-Taha-Boty
Assignment for Mezzanine Application

This is a basic to-do app using React. There is a counter displaying the number of complete and incomplete tasks. There is also a button in order to highlight a certain task as 'priority'. Furthermore, the user can click the redo button in order to "un-complete" a task on the to-do list.


The app can be run by going inside the `todo-app` directory on the command prompt and entering `npm start`. This will open the app on a local host development server.
